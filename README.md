## Description

_{Create an app for a University registrar to keep track of students and courses. Here are some user stories for you - build one at a time before moving on to the next one.

As a registrar, I want to enter a student, so I can keep track of all students enrolled at this University. I should be able to provide a name and date of enrollment.
As a registrar, I want to enter a course, so I can keep track of all of the courses the University offers. I should be able to provide a course name and a course number (ex. HIST100). *As a registrar, I want to be able to assign students to a course, so that teachers know which students are in their course. A course can have many students and a student can take many courses at the same time.}_

## Setup


_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Are there other applications this app depends on?}_

## Technologies Used

_{Tell me about the languages you used to create this app. Assume that I know you probably used HTML and CSS. If you did something really cool using only HTML, point that out.}_
